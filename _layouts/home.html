        <h2>Introduction to the Nix package manager</h2>
        <p>
        The dapp tool builds on <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a>, a package
          manager with properties that make it uniquely robust, far beyond tools
          like npm, and uniquely self-contained.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't need knowledge of Nix to operate dapp, but we recommend anyone
          interested in system administration or software deployment to learn about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nix's robustness is due to its use of cryptographic digests to track dependencies
          and configurations. This fits naturally with the blockchain paradigm â€” we're in
          the age of hashes.

          The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model</a> describes the system in detail.
          Print it out for a rainy day, it's worth reading.
