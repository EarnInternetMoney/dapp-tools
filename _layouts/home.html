            <h2>About Nix</h2>
            <p class="lead">Introduction to the Nix package manager</p>
            <p>
              Our tools build on <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a>, a package
              manager with properties that make it uniquely robust, far beyond tools
              like npm, and uniquely self-contained.
            </p>
            <p>
              You don't need knowledge of Nix in order to use these tools, but we recommend anyone
              interested in system administration or software deployment to learn about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nix's robustness is due to its use of cryptographic digests to track dependencies
              and configurations. This fits naturally with the blockchain paradigm â€” we're in
              the age of hashes.

              The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model</a> describes the system in detail.
              Print it out for a rainy day, it's worth reading.
