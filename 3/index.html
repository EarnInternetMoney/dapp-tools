<h1>Tools for dapps</h1>

  Developing for Ethereum demands a suite of tools to help with
  construction, correctness, deployment, and management.

<p>
  The open source toolkit by <a href=https://dapphub.com>DappHub</a> consists of
  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt><a href=https://github.com/dapphub/dapp>dapp</a></tt>, a command line tool that
      initializes, compiles, links, tests, deploys, and interacts with
      Ethereum contracts;
    <li>
      <tt><a href=https://github.com/dapphub/seth>seth</a></tt>, a utility knife for slicing and dicing
      transactions, performing remote calls, and converting between data formats; and
    <li>
      <tt><a href=https://github.com/dapphub/hevm>hevm</a></tt>, an EVM implementation designed for
       testing and verification, with a nimble debugger that runs in
       the terminal.
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  We prefer tools that are fast, transparent, and good citizens of
  the command line, and that's how we've built the <tt>dapp</tt> suite.
</p>

<p>
  These tools grew out of our work on <a href=#>Maker</a> and
  other consulting projects.

<h1>Installing the DappHub toolkit</h1>

We recommend using the <a href=https://nixos.org>Nix package
manager</a> to install these tools.  It works on Linux and OS X, and
we maintain a channel with all our software along with the Solidity
compiler (several versions).

<p>
<pre>
<b># Install Nix:</b>
curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

<b># Add the <!--
--><a href=https://github.com/dapphub/nixpkgs-dapphub>DappHub channel</a> to Nix:</b>
nix-channel --add https://nix.dapphub.com/pkgs/dapphub
nix-channel --update

<b># Install the various developer tools:</b>
nix-env -iA dapphub.{<!--
--><a href=https://github.com/dapphub/dapp>dapp</a>,<!--
--><a href=https://github.com/dapphub/hevm>hevm</a>,<!--
--><a href=https://github.com/dapphub/seth>seth</a>,<!--
--><a href=https://github.com/ethereum/solidity>solc</a>}
</pre>

<h1>Learning</h1>

These tools have been satisfying our own needs, and now we're getting
them ready for everyone to use.

<p>Until we publish learning material&mdash;manuals, videos,
tutorials&mdash;the best way to learn is to install the tools and then
look at a project like
<a href=https://github.com/dapphub/ds-token><tt>ds-token</tt></a>.

<p>You should also join <a href=https://dapphub.chat>our chat</a>
where we'll be able to help you get started.
