DappHub is a community of developers, computer scientists, security researchers,
type theorists working on blockchain software. Our suite of tools has grown through
our work on <a href="http://www.makerdao.com">Maker</a> and other consulting
projects and designed to ease the correct construction and deployment of
distributed applications.

Our open source <a href=https://dapphub.com>toolkit</a> includes:
<ul>
  <li>
    <tt><a href="{% link dapp.html %}">dapp</a></tt> build, test,
    deploy and transact with Ethereum contracts from the comfort of the
    command line.
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt><a href=https://github.com/dapphub/seth>seth</a></tt>, a utility knife for slicing and dicing
      transactions, performing remote calls, and converting between data formats; and
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt><a href=https://github.com/dapphub/hevm>hevm</a></tt>, an EVM implementation designed for
        testing and verification, with a nimble debugger that runs in
        the terminal.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We like tools that are fast, transparent, and good citizens of
    the command line, which is how we've built the <tt>dapp</tt> suite.
