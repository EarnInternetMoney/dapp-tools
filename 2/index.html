<h1>Tools for dapps</h1>

<p>
  Developing for Ethereum demands a suite of tools to help with
  construction, correctness, deployment, and management.
</p>

<p>
  The open source toolkit by <a href=#>DappHub</a> consists of
  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt><a href=#>dapp</a></tt>, the main entry point, a command line tool that
      initializes, builds, links, tests, deploys, and interacts with
      Ethereum contracts;
    <li>
      <tt><a href=#>seth</a></tt>, a utility knife that constructs and sends
      transactions, queries blockchain nodes for data, and converts
      between formats; and
    <li>
      <tt><a href=#>hevm</a></tt>, an EVM implementation designed for
       testing and verification, with a nimble debugger that runs in
       the terminal.
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  These tools make up a coherent environment for developing dapps.
  They're what we use to work on <a href=#>Maker</a> and our
  consulting projects.
</p>

<h2>Installing, upgrading, and removing</h2>

<p>
Here's the recommended way to install the tools:
<pre>
curl <a href=https://dapp.tools/install>https://dapp.tools/install</a> | sh
</pre>

If you want to install the tools manually, the script serves as
documentation.  Don't worry, though&mdash;it's safe and easy
to undo.

<h2>Dappsys&mdash;verified contract components</h2>

<p>
  Fundamental to our strategy is
      <tt><a href=#>dappsys</a></tt>, a set of composable building
      blocks with formally verified semantics for well-behaved
      contracts.  Some of the components are
      <ul>
        <li><tt><a href=#>ds-token</a></tt>, a generic EIP-20 coin;</li>
        <li><tt><a href=#>ds-cabal</a></tt>, a multisig;</li>
        <li><tt><a href=#>ds-guard</a></tt>, a flexible authority rule;</li>
        <li><tt><a href=#>ds-proxy</a></tt>, a transaction proxy; and</li>
        <li><tt><a href=#>ds-cache</a></tt>, a store of expiring values.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>


<h2>Upgrading and uninstalling</h2>
You can switch to the latest release of the toolkit:
<p>
  <pre>dapp self-upgrade</pre>
<p>
  You can also completely remove it, leaving no trace:
  <pre>dapp self-destroy</pre>
</p>

<h2>Introduction to the Nix package manager</h2> The installation
infrastructure that <tt>dapp</tt> builds on is <a href=#>Nix</a>, a
package manager with properties that make it uniquely robust, far
beyond tools like <tt>npm</tt>.

<p>Nix's robustness is due to its use of cryptography to track
dependencies and configurations.  This fits naturally with the
blockchain paradigm&mdash;we're in the age of hashes.

<p>
You don't need knowledge of Nix to operate <tt>dapp</tt>, but we
recommend anyone interested in system administration or software
deployment to learn about it.

<p>
Eelco Dolstra's 2006 Ph.D. thesis, <a href=#>"The Purely Functional
Software Deployment Model"</a>, describes the system in detail.
Print it out for a rainy day&mdash;it's worth reading.
