<h1>Tools for dapps</h1>

  Developing for Ethereum demands a suite of tools to help with
  construction, correctness, deployment, and management.

<p>
  The open source toolkit by <a href=#>DappHub</a> consists of
  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt><a href=#>dapp</a></tt>, a command line tool that
      initializes, compiles, links, tests, deploys, and interacts with
      Ethereum contracts;
    <li>
      <tt><a href=#>seth</a></tt>, a utility knife for slicing and dicing
      transactions, performing remote calls, and converting between data formats; and
    <li>
      <tt><a href=#>hevm</a></tt>, an EVM implementation designed for
       testing and verification, with a nimble debugger that runs in
       the terminal.
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  We prefer tools that are fast, transparent, and good citizens of
  the command line, and that's how we've built the <tt>dapp</tt> suite.
</p>

<p>
  These tools grew out of our work on <a href=#>Maker</a> and
  other consulting projects.
</p>

<h1>Verified contract components</h1>

  The other half of our development strategy is
   <tt><a href=#>Dappsys</a></tt>, a pattern language of contracts
   with formally verified semantics.  It includes
   <ul>
     <li><tt><a href=#>ds-token</a></tt>, a generic EIP-20 coin;</li>
     <li><tt><a href=#>ds-cabal</a></tt>, a multisig;</li>
     <li><tt><a href=#>ds-guard</a></tt>, a flexible authority rule;</li>
     <li><tt><a href=#>ds-proxy</a></tt>, a transaction proxy; and</li>
     <li><tt><a href=#>ds-cache</a></tt>, a store of expiring values.</li>
   </ul>
  </ul>

<p>Using these proven parts lets us focus on the novel features of
the systems we develop.

<p>We share Dappsys under a free software license to benefit the
smart contract ecosystem.

<h1>Installing the DappHub toolkit</h1>

<p>
We recommend using our installer. The system is nonintrusive and can be completely
uninstalled later.
<pre>
<b>$ curl <a href=https://dapp.tools/install>https://dapp.tools/install</a> | sh</b>
(1/4) Downloading...
(2/4) Installing Nix environment...
(3/4) Refreshing package channel...
(4/4) Installing base packages...

Done! Try `dapp new my-dapp' or `dapp help'.
</pre>

If you'd rather install manually, the script serves as documentation.

<p>
You can switch to the latest release of the toolkit:
<pre>
<b>$ dapp self-upgrade</b>
Installed new versions:
  dapp v1.2    (was v1.1)
  solc v0.4.6  (was v0.4.5)
</pre>
  
<p>
  You can also uninstall it.  After this there should be no trace of the
  system left on your computer.
<pre>
<b>$ dapp self-destroy</b>
Dapp tools removed.
</pre>
</p>

<h1>Introduction to the Nix package manager</h1>

The <tt>dapp</tt> tool builds on <a href=#>Nix</a>, a package manager
with properties that make it uniquely robust, far beyond tools like
<tt>npm</tt>, and uniquely self-contained.

<p>
You don't need knowledge of Nix to operate <tt>dapp</tt>, but we
recommend anyone interested in system administration or software
deployment to learn about it.

<p>Nix's robustness is due to its use of cryptographic digests to
track dependencies and configurations.  This fits naturally with the
blockchain paradigm&mdash;we're in the age of hashes.

<p>
Eelco Dolstra's 2006 Ph.D. thesis, <a href=#>"The Purely Functional
Software Deployment Model"</a>, describes the system in detail.
Print it out for a rainy day&mdash;it's worth reading.
